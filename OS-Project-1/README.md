In this project, I created a simple program in C that implements an
application using RPC as the layer of communication between the client and the server. The
project consists of three separate parts; local procedure (part_a), remote procedure (part_b), and logging (part_c). The
local procedure part includes the creation of several processes and executing a binary file. The
remote procedure part includes the creation of remote processes and executing a binary file.
The logging part, includes remotely logging of the inputs and outputs.
